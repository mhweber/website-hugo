I’m a geographer working at the [US EPA’s Western Ecology Division](https://www.epa.gov/aboutepa/about-western-ecology-division-wed-epas-national-health-and-environmental-effects-research) in Corvallis, OR. My work focuses on using spatial analysis in the realm of aquatic ecology, and particularly using spatial analysis in support of the [EPA’s National Aquatic Resource Surveys](https://www.epa.gov/national-aquatic-resource-surveys). A particular focus of my work is geospatial analysis in R and Python, and partiularly the use of open source approaches in these two programming languages.
