I’m a geographer working at the [US EPA’s Pacific Ecological Systems Division](https://www.epa.gov/aboutepa/about-pacific-ecological-systems-division-pesd) in Corvallis, OR. My research interests include spatial analysis in R and Python, Geographic Information Science (GIS), aquatic ecology,remote sensing, open source science and environmental modeling. Much of my work focuses on  using spatial analysis in support of the [EPA’s National Aquatic Resource Surveys](https://www.epa.gov/national-aquatic-resource-surveys).
