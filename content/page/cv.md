## Research and Work Experience

**2008 -- Present: Spatial Analyst, US Environmental Protection Agency, Western Ecology Division, Corvallis, OR**

- I work as a geographer / spatial analyst, providing geospatial support for the EPA National Aquatic Resource Surveys (NARS) and helping build national predictive models and maps of watershed integrity and aquatic condition. I develop approaches primarily in Python and R, as well as using ArcGIS, to process landscape data for spatial designs and modeling, and to interact with the National Hydrography Dataset Plus (NHDPlus). The NARS support work involves providing the spatial framework and geospatial analysis support for the national lakes, rivers and streams, wetlands, and coastal surveys. I have active collaborations with colleagues from other EPA labs (NHEERL AED, MED, GED),divisions (NERL, NCEA), offices and regions (OW, Regions 6 and 7), as well as other agencies and universites (USGS, Utah State, Desert Research Institute). I do extensive work with open source GIS tools in both R and Python, am interested in methods for spatial data visualization using tools such as Bokeh in Python and R Shiny in R, and I am a user and proponent of reproducible research techniques using Git / R Markdown / knitr/ Python notebooks.

**2005 -- 2008: GIS Specialist, U.S. Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station Fire Sciences Lab, Missoula, MT**

- Worked on the USFS [Landfire](http://www.landfire.gov/) program on the fire regimes team.  Ran and modified fire / landscape simulation models (LANDSUM, VDDT), processed spatial data using scripting languages (Python and AML), and performed advanced spatial analysis on fire and fuels data using SQL, Python, VBA, and R.  Processed raster data using map algebra for analysis of national fire and fuels mapping products.  Interacted and worked closely with personnel from partner agencies such as USGS EROS data center and the Nature Conservancy.

**2003 -- 2005: Biologist, U.S. Forest Service, Rocky  Mountain Research Station Fire Sciences Lab, Missoula, MT**

- Managed research project examining historical fire regimes in Utah.  Work included planning, locating, installing and taking measurements at research plots using increment borers, chainsaws, gps unit and rangefinder, as well as using dendrochonology techniques and software (COFECHA, FHX2) for dating fire-scarred samples.  Processed, summarized, analyzed data and prepared reports on fire history data collected.  Performed spatial analysis and map production using ArcMap software and AML scripts.  Performed statistica analyses on data using SAS.

**2001 -- 2003: Ecologist, U.S. Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station Forestry Sciences Lab, Portland, OR**

- Supervised field crew for the Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program, and prepared field methods and summarized data during winter.  Performed database development in Access and Oracle of inventory plot data for Oregon, Washington, and California.  Work required advanced photo interpretation, plant identification, forest pathogen identification, and use of laser rangefinder, GPS, data logger, increment borer, and clinometer.  Prepared plot maps and performed spatial queries using ArcGIS, helped model forest mortality from plot data as part of a pilot study.

**2000 -- 2003: Instructor, Portland Community College, Portland, OR**

- Taught two 1 credit geography field courses each term, one on Mt. St. Helens and one on the Oregon High Desert.  Delivered day-long courses focusing on geography and natural history of the areas.  Developed course curriculum, supervised approximately 50 community college students on day long field classes, and graded student papers.

**1999 -- 2001: Assistant Editor, Himalayan Research Bulletin, Portland State University, Portland, OR**

- Managed layout and editing of international journal on geographic and cultural research on the Himalayas.  Performed journal layout using Adobe Pagemaker, Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe Illustrator software.  Performed general office management tasks such as updating membership, correspondence, billing and mailing.

**1999: Research Assistant, Portland State University Department of Geography, Portland, OR**

- Assisted in research project on tree-islands (kipukas) in lava flows at Newbarry Crater National Monument, examining fire history and insect outbreaks.  Collected tree increment cores, identified plants using plant keys, and measured fuel loading on sample plots.

## Qualifications Memberships and Activities

### Programming
#### Python
  
- I've worked with Python extensively as an integral part of work since 2005.  I learned Python on the job working on the US Forest Service [Landfire](http://www.landfire.gov/) program where we used Python for most of our workflow scripts.  Additionally, I participated in a week-long Python immersion class in person with Mark Lutz, author of Programming Python and Learning Python, while working for the LANDFIRE program.  I've continued to develop my Python programming skills using both the ArcGIS ArcPy module as well as many open source spatial modules in Python, and most recently have begun using Python notebooks for reproducible research and Python modules such as Bokeh for data visualization. I am also a co-lead of the newly formed EPA Python Community of Practice.
      
#### R  
  
- I started learning R in 2003 and have spent a great deal of time working with R for spatial analysis.  I've taught several webinars and workshops on doing spatial analysis in R, and helped to author the micromap package for R.  As with Python, I'm very interested in reproducible research methods in R and write the majority of my R scripts as R markdown documents which I knit into html or pdf documents using the knitr package.  Additionaly, I've created most of my recent presentations and posters using some combination of knitr / LaTex / Beamer in R.
  
#### Web
  
- Up until last year I maintained the EPA Ecoregions website, performing routine updates and editing in html.  I know HTML, CSS, and some Javascript. I'm also familiar with and using GitHub pages, Hugo, and Jekyll for content manamement.  
  
  
### Data Management and Analysis
#### GIS
  
- I've used ESRI ArcGIS products extensively for work for the past 15 years since first learning GIS in graduate school.  I have expert level experience in using the ArcPy module in python and GIS scripting in Python, and additionally use a number of open source GIS modules in Python (fiona, rasterio, gdal, shapely, geopandas, georasters).  Additionally, I've used R for much of my spatial analysis in the past 6 years, and am very familiar with the typical R libraries for spatial analysis (sp, rgdal, rgeos, raster).

#### Statistics
  
- I've taken several graduate level statistics courses, including multivariate statistics, and work closely with statisticians in my daily work.  I do all my statistical work in R currently and for the past several years, and have also used SAS, SPSS, and SigmaPlot.
  
#### Data Science and Data Visualization
  
- Much of my daily work falls under the rubric of 'Data Science', and I use both R and Python for data management, data acquisition, data cleaning, and data transformation.  I've used the libraries and modules in both languages that lend themselves to data manament / data cleaning tasks, such as tidyr, dpyr, ggplot2, reshape2, plyr, and stringr in R and pandas, numpy, abd scipy.  I also use both R and Python for data visualization, using libraries such as plotly, RColorBrewer, choroplethr, micromap, ggplot2, leaflet, and shiny in R, and matplotlib, bokeh, seaborn, and ggplot.  I also use PostGreSQL / PostGIS for storing, manipulating and querying spatial data.
