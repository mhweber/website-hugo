## Current Position

I work as a geographer / spatial analyst, providing geospatial support for the EPA National Aquatic Resource Surveys (NARS) and for work in building national predictive models and maps of watershed integrity and aquatic condition. I develop approaches primarily in Python and R, as well as using ArcGIS, to process landscape data for spatial designs and modeling, and to interact with the National Hydrography Dataset Plus (NHDPlus). The NARS support work involves providing the spatial framework and geospatial analysis support for the national lakes, rivers and streams, wetlands, and coastal surveys. I have active collaborations with colleagues from other EPA labs (NHEERL AED, MED, GED),divisions (NERL, NCEA), offices and regions (OW, Regions 6 and 7), as well as other agencies and universites (USGS, Utah State, Desert Research Institute). I do extensive work with open source GIS tools in both R and Python, am interested in methods for spatial data visualization using tools such as Bokeh in Python and R Shiny in R, and I am a user and proponent of reproducible research techniques using Git / R Markdown / knitr/ Python notebooks.
